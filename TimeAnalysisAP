#I have named my dataset waitdata

#line 22: third quarter dataframe


#Here I am naming a few of the variables in order to simplify the analytical process 
days<- waitdata$DayOfYear
waittime <- waitdata$Wait
month <- waitdata$Month
weekday(waitdata$DayOfWeek)

#Next, I will visualize days, months, according to their wait time 
hist(weekday)
hist(month)

     main = 'Number of Appointments by Day', col = 'blue')
     
#there seems to be minimal difference in the number of scheduled appointments on each day of the week but there is a 
#visible drop in appointments in July through October, this is confirmed with the histogram made for days of the week. 
#This warrants further exploration. 

July <- waitdata[waitdata$Month== '7',]
August <- waitdata[waitdata$Month== '8',]
Sept <- waitdata[waitdata$Month== '9',]
Oct<- waitdata[waitdata$Month== '10',]
thirdquarter <- rbind(July,August,Sept,Oct)

barplot(thirdquarter$Wait)

#I can see that there is a lot of negative wait time within these months, how does this compare with the rest of the year?

monthlyavg<-tapply(waitdata$Wait, waitdata$Month, FUN = mean)
barplot(monthlyavg)

#In January, October, November, and December, the average wait time at any moment throughout the day is higher, why is that?

Dayavg <-tapply(waitdata$Wait, waitdata$DayOfYear, FUN = mean)
barplot(Dayavg)
# The negative wait time could be playing a role in the average wait time of a patient at this hospital. 


#How many appointments are there on any given day at this hospital?
#Lubridate can be used to separate the time stamps into a format that is easier to analyze,

library(lubridate)
waitdata$parsedappt<-parse_date_time(waitdata$x_ScheduledDTTM, 'y-m-d H:M:S')

waitdata$calendar<-date(waitdata$parsedappt)

#This will help us to figure out the total number of appointments 
calendarsum<- table(waitdata$calendar)
calendarsum[order(calendarsum$Freq),]

#On any given day, there are between fourteen and seventy appointments per day.
mean(calendarsum$Freq)
#the average number of appointments is 51.26739


# Is there any statistical significance to the day of year and the wait time? I will run regression analysis to see. 
plot(waitdata$Wait, waitdata$DayOfYear)

daymodel <- lm(Wait~DayOfYear, data=waitdata)
summary(daymodel)

abline(daymodel, col='blue')

#The multiple R squared is 0.001747 which means that it is not statistically significant but there is some type of signficiant movement in certain times of year 
#how can we look into this further? Can we use the analysis to narrow down certain parts of the year and analyse it based on that?

#Idea 1: Lets separate the data into quarters and analysis based on that.
# Idea 2: Analyise What is going during days when there is negative wait time? Maybe we can separate that time out and see what the wait times are looking 
#like in departments and what the congestion is looking like. 

#Additional Questions: Should we work with average wait time rather than sum of wiat time?

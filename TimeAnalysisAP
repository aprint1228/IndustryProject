#there seems to be minimal difference in the number of scheduled appointments on each day of the week but there is a 
#visible drop in appointments in July through October, this is confirmed with the histogram made for days of the week. 
#This warrants further exploration.

#In January, October, November, and December, the average wait time at any moment throughout the day is higher, why is that?

# The negative wait time could be playing a role in the average wait time of a patient at this hospital. 


#How many appointments are there on any given day at this hospital?
#Lubridate can be used to separate the time stamps into a format that is easier to analyze,
